# 🩺 Claro Lens

**Medical bills are confusing by design. Claro Lens fixes that.**

Claro Lens is a privacy-first iOS app that acts as your personal health billing advocate. Photograph a medical bill, EOB, lab result, or insurance card — Claro uses Claude AI to translate every line item into plain English, flag potential billing errors, and tell you exactly what to do next.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repo and open `Claro.xcodeproj` in Xcode

2. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker** (keeps your Anthropic key out of the binary):
   - Go to [Cloudflare Workers & Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → Create Worker → name it `claro-proxy`
   - Paste the contents of `cloudflare-worker/src/index.js` into the editor and Deploy
   - Under Settings → Variables and Secrets, add two secrets:
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — your Anthropic key
     - `CLARO_APP_SECRET` — any strong random string you choose

3. Create `Claro/Config.swift` (gitignored):

```swift
import Foundation

enum Config {
    static let workerURL = URL(string: "https://claro-proxy.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/v1/messages")!
    static let workerSecret = "<your-CLARO_APP_SECRET>"

    enum Epic {
        static let sandboxClientID    = "your-epic-sandbox-client-id"
        static let productionClientID = "your-epic-production-client-id"
        static let redirectURI        = "com.ryancurran.ios.Claro://oauth/callback"
        static let sandboxFHIRBase    = "https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4"
    }
}
```

4. Set your development team in the target's Signing & Capabilities tab
5. Build and run on device (VisionKit document camera requires a physical device)

## 💡 Why

Things that used to require a team of medical billing coders, insurance advocates, and healthcare attorneys are now buildable by one motivated developer with the right AI. Claro Lens is a labor of love — built to give ordinary people the same quality of billing oversight that was previously only available to those who could afford a professional advocate.
